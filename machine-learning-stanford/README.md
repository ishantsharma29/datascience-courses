# Machine Learning (Coursera)
This is my solution to all the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms.Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code. This is all written in matlab. The datasets are also uploaded with the excercises
